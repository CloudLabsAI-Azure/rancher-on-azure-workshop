# Kubernetes Management with SUSE Rancher on Microsoft Azure



## Abstract and learning objectives

This is an in-depth workshops designed to give DevOps and IT teams the hands-on skills they need to deploy and manage Kubernetes everywhere with SUSE Rancher running on Microsoft Azure.

 

The content will be delivered by technical experts and aim to educate anyone interested in learning how to use containers or Kubernetes.

 

During these virtual hands-on workshops, our technical experts will provide an introduction to Rancher, Docker, and Kubernetes and then walk through the steps for deploying a Kubernetes cluster.

 

The key topics that will be covered at the workshop include:

- Docker and Kubernetes Concepts and Architecture
- Installation and Configuration of Rancher Server
- Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
- Application Deployment and Access

## Having trouble?

First, verify you have followed all written lab instructions (including the Before the Hands-on lab document).

Next, submit an issue with a detailed description of the problem.

Do not submit pull requests. Our content authors will make all changes and submit pull requests for approval.

If you are planning to present a workshop, review and test the materials early! We recommend at least two weeks prior.

Please allow 5 - 10 business days for review and resolution of issues.





## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will build a proof of concept (POC) that will transform an existing on-premises application to a container-based application. This POC will deliver a multi-tenant web app hosting solution leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Docker containers on Linux nodes, and a migration from MongoDB to CosmosDB.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to improve the reliability of and increase the release cadence of your container-based applications through time-tested DevOps practices.



## Target Audience

1. Application developer
2. Infrastructure architect
   



Fabrikam Medical Conferences provides conference web site services, tailored to the medical community. Their business has grown and the management of many instances of the code base and change cycle per tenant has gotten out of control.

The goal of this workshop is to help them build a proof of concept (POC) that will migrate their code to a more manageable process that involves containerization of tenant code, a better DevOps workflow, and a simple lift-and-shift story for their database backend.

Abstracts


## Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn about the choices related to building and deploying containerized applications in Azure, critical decisions around this, and other aspects of the solution, including ways to lift-and-shift parts of the application to reduce applications changes.

By the end of this design session, you will be better able to design solutions that target Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and define a DevOps workflow for containerized applications.

## Hands-on Lab

This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the process of building and deploying Docker images to the Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), in addition to learning how to work with dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high-availability.

At the end of this lab, you will be better able to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps procedures.
